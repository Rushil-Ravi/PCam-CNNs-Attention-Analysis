# PCam-CNNs-Attention-Analysis
This project explores the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) enhanced with attention mechanisms to improve the classification of metastatic tissue in histopathological images from the PatchCamelyon (PCam) dataset. The dataset consists of 327,680 labeled images from lymph node sections, which serve as a benchmark for automated cancer detection. By integrating attention layers (channel and spatial attention) into the CNN architecture, the model can focus on the most critical regions in the images, improving classification accuracy and interpretability. The results show that the CNN with attention outperforms the baseline model, achieving higher accuracy (83.1% vs. 78.6%), F1 score (80.8% vs. 73.6%), and recall (70.9% vs. 59.8%), while reducing false negatives and improving generalization. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of attention mechanisms for enhancing CNN models in complex tasks like medical imaging, with potential applications in automated cancer detection.
